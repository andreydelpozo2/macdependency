#summary Features of macdependency
#labels Featured
= Features =
  * shows all dependencies of a Mach-O file
  * shows versions and compatible version numbers of libraries and bundles
  * shows all imported/exported functions of each dependency as well as the root file
  * shows warnings if a dependent library is not found or only found in an incompatible version

= Open Issues =
  * Due to a problem with QProcess, which is already reported to QtSoftware, it is currently not possible to demangle C++ method names. It will be enabled, as soon as a workaround or a patched version of Qt is available.
  * So far library names containing @loader_library or @rpath are not supported. Those libraries are currently not found by macdependency.
