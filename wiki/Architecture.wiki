#summary Architecture of macdependency
#labels Phase-Design,Featured

= Overview =
macdependency consists out of two separate projects
  * macdependency, which contains the GUI as well as some checking functionality for existing dependencies.
  * macho, which provides access to the properties of Mach-O files in the form of a static library.

= Used Libraries =
Both macdependency and macho make use of Qt (http://www.qtsoftware.com), although this program does only make sense on a Mac. I chose that library because it provides a nice abstraction layer of pure cocoa programming. I also used the file access methods of Qt.
