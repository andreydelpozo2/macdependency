#summary Architecture of macdependency
#labels Phase-Design,Featured

= Overview =
MacDependency consists out of two separate projects
  * MacDependency, which contains the Cocoa GUI as well as some checking functionality for existing dependencies.
  * MachO, which provides access to the properties of Mach-O files in the form of a static library (mostly platform independent code).

= Used Libraries =
MachO uses some libraries from boost
 * [http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_40_0/libs/filesystem/index.html filesystem] for file handling
 * [http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_40_0/libs/system/doc/index.html system] as dependent library from filesystem
 * [http://www.highscore.de/boost/process/ process] (still in incubation) to start c++filt for demangling file names
